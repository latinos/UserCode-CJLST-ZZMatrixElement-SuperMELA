****************************
1) : calculate superMELA


-)the idea is to take in input the stat trees of CJLST (ask Mario, Cri and Nic)
and produce copies of the trees with additional branches including superMELA.
the susperMELA discriminant needs in input the Psig and Pbkg of MELA plus
the m4l analytical shapes of signal and background. 

Psig(MELA) and Pbkg(MELA) can be passed as inputs in case they were 
pre-calculated. For instance they can be read from the same stat trees in input. 
This is the default behaviour and it is fast.
Alternatively, they can be recalculated on the fly (slow because of analytical bkg shape!). 
Notice that in this way one can create a superMELA discriminant not just using MELA
plus m4l but using nloMELA plus m4l. You must change the source code of the 
class and switch to true the withPt and withY flags of the MELA computation
(and recompile, of course). 

The parameters of the m4l shape are read directly from the input cards
used by the combination package in HiggsAnalysis/HZZ4L_CombinationPy/CreateDatacards/SM_inputs_8TeV/
(or 7TeV, you can set where to go and read the input cards). 

WARNING #1 (2012/10/12): I had problems in interfacing the code to Matt's
class that calculates the theoretical width of the Higgs. This is used for
defining the m4l window in use. Since in any case we are not interested
to anything else than mH=125 or mH=126, I hard-coded these values. To be fixed.

-) for an example of how to use the SuperMELA class, refer to the macros
test/testSuperMELAKD.C
test/prodSuperMELAKD.C

prodSuperMELAKD.C is probably more realistic and this is what was used 
for the tests done so far for the signal separation. 
testSuperMELAKD.C is easier to follow, though. I would start by giving 
a look at this and then moving to prodSuperMELAKD.C

-) in prodSuperMELAKD you set the input directory, the output directory,
the name of the samples to loop on and the sqrtS. These params are all
defined at the top of the macro. Then, in a root session:

[0] .x loadMELA.C
[1] .L prodSuperMELAKD.C++
[2] prodSuperMELAKD()

and you let it go.

2) : generate 2D templates

once you have flat trees containing superMELA, you can generate 2D templates
(TH2F) with superMELA and psMELA (or graviMELA, it should be in the stat trees
of the batch of October 2012). 

-) Use the macro HiggsAnalysis/HZZ4L_CombinationPy/AnalysisInputs/generateTemplatesSMD.C
Edit the "Really important parameters" section at the top of the file. There are
more details in the comments next to the variables.
Also, you should change in the file AnalysisInputs/ConfigSMD.h the dirs with the
new trees with superMELA. Then it's just a matter of doing
root -q -b loadMELA.C generateTemplatesSMD.C+

You may also need a dummy observed dataset with superMELA in it.
There is the script generateDummyObsDataSMD.C that does it. This macro is
really crappy, I apologize but I didn't have time to clean it up. In a ROOT
session you compile it and then execute it passing as argument the 
desired integrated lumi. The code reads in the MC files and samples randomly
events out of them, according to the desired lumi.



****************************
3) : create cards and ws

Great, you have 2D templates with superMELA !!!
Now you have just to create cards and workspaces. For the time being 
I have only some temporary code that duplicates what is on CVS.
The short-medium term plan is to merge the superMELA stuff into it.
For the time being, you should copy in HiggsAnalysis/HZZ4L_CombinationPy/CreateDatacards/
some files from ZZMatrixElement/SuperMELA/

cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/
cp ZZMatrixElement/SuperMELA/scripts/datacardClassSMD.py  HiggsAnalysis/HZZ4L_CombinationPy/CreateDatacards/
cp ZZMatrixElement/SuperMELA/scripts/systematicsClassSMD.py  HiggsAnalysis/HZZ4L_CombinationPy/CreateDatacards/
cp ZZMatrixElement/SuperMELA/scripts/makeDCsandWSsSMD.py  HiggsAnalysis/HZZ4L_CombinationPy/CreateDatacards/
cd HiggsAnalysis/HZZ4L_CombinationPy/CreateDatacards/

You must set the correct flags and parameters in the default input cards in SM_inputs_8TeV 
for creating cards and ws suitable for hypothesis testing !

Run it using makeDCsandWSsSMD.py instead of the usual makeDCsandWSs.py (example for 8TeV):
python makeDCsandWSsSMD.py -i SM_inputs_8TeV -a HypTest_smd_8TeV -b -t templates2D_smd_8TeV/ > output_HypTest_smd_8TeV.txt

This special version of datacardClass will produce cards to be used with Combine !
Also, there is no point in creating cards and ws for a mass different
to what was used in the calculation of superMELA for the templates.

WARNING: the special scripts for making cards for Hyp separation is based on
the tag bonato_supermela_20121021 of the card-making package.
Make sure that there were no relevant updates on top of it. A better
solution thta does not force us to keep the packages in sync by hand
has to be worked out in the future.
