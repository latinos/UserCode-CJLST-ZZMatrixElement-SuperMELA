************** A: Template generation: ********

1) cd  Combination_Py/AnalysisInputs/SuperMELA/
2) edit in ConfigSMD.h the path to the CJLST trees
3) edit in generateTemplates_V3.C and generateTemplates_forCR_V3.C
the type of spin hyp to test, the path to the templates the sqrts... everything
in the set of global vars at the beginning of the file. If you are not happy
with the binning of the templates, change it (just under the global vars).
4) run the two macros with the command written in the comment at the very top,
first for 7TeV and then 8TeV: 
root -q -b ../loadMELA.C generateTemplatesSMD_V3.C+
root -q -b ../loadMELA.C generateTemplatesSMD_forCR_V3.C+



********  B : card creation *****************
1) if they are not yet, copy the two dirs with templates in CreateDatacards/ and go there
2) make sure to have the latest SM_inputs_7TeV and SM_inputs_8TeV dirs .
On CVS, they are here:
http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/UserCode/HZZ4L_Combination/CombinationPy/CreateDatacards/SM_inputs_8TeV/

You must set the correct flags and parameters in the default 
input cards in SM_inputs_8TeV for creating cards and ws suitable 
for hypothesis testing ! In particular, in order 
to properly activate the shape systematics, 
the input cards should have these settings:

### for hypothesis testing ###
doHypTest True
#altHypLabel _ALT
systematic CMS_zz4l_bkgMELA True
systematic CMS_zz4l_sigMELA True
systematic CMS_zz4l_mean False
systematic CMS_zz4l_sigma False
systematic CMS_zz4l_mean False
systematic CMS_zz4l_sigma False
systematic CMS_zz4l_n False
systematic CMS_zz4l_gamma False


3) go in CMSdata/ and run the script create_dataobs.C twice, once for 7TeV
and another for 8TeV . Of course, make sure that the path to CJLST trees is in synch
with what used for the templates, and the luminosities are in sync with wehat is in the
SM_inputs_XTeV
4) run the datacard making script (example for 8 TeV, to be done also for 7TeV):
python makeDCsandWSsSMD.py -i SM_inputs_8TeV -a HypTest_smd_8TeV_TEST -b -t templates2D_smd_8TeV_TEST --spinHyp=0 > output_HypTest_smd_7TeV_TEST.txt

for the meaning of the options, refer to the code in makeDCsandWSsSMD.py and datacardClassSMD.py
5) merge the cards (first the 7TeV and then the 8TeV !!!) :
./mergeCards.sh cards_HypTest_smd_7TeV_TEST cards_HypTest_smd_8TeV_TEST  126

**** C : sig separation  **********************
1) copy the dir cards_HypTest_smd_8TeV_TEST  in SignalSeparation/
2) follow instructions in
http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/UserCode/HZZ4L_Combination/CombinationPy/SignalSeparation/instructions.txt?view=log
